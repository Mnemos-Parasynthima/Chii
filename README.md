## Setup:
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12 or higher if not already done so.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Install build tools (for use of Canvas) with terminal.
    - `npm install --global windows-build-tools`
4. Install dependencies with `npm install` with terminal.
5. Create a discord bot application with [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/).
6. Fill out the config.json file with `token`, `ownerId` (must have developer tools enabled in Discord to access it), and `prefix`. The default prefix is `chii` in order not to confuse with common prefixes such as !, -, or $. Using a mention also works as part of the Commando framework.
7. Using the link from the developer portal, invite to your server.
8. To run locally, use `npm start`. To host 24/7, I recommend using [replit](https://repl.it/) and [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).

## Modification:
You can modify Chii's code but make sure to leave credit on the README file or somewhere visible.

## Contribution:
Chii doesn't have an official support server for now, only a small development place used to test out features from Chii and others.
If any bugs or error pop up, feel free to open up an issue and give any important information.
If you have an idea, great! If you know how to program, feel free to add anything and open a pull request and I will see it. However, if you do not know, it's all fine! Open up an issue with the title of "New Idea" and describe the ideas, and I will look into it.


Currently, I am not looking for collaborators as I'm too lazy. However, I might consider it should I want to take Chii further.  Make sure to keep up to date. :)
